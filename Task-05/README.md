# 🚗 Task-05 – US Traffic Accident Data Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to:
- Road conditions
- Weather
- Time of day
- Accident severity
- Geographic hotspots

---

## 📊 Dataset Used
US Accidents Dataset (Sample Version)
Original dataset size: 3GB (7.7M+ records)

A representative sample of 100,000 records was used for analysis.

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

### ⏰ Time-Based Analysis
- Accidents by hour
- Monthly trends
- Day-of-week patterns

### 🌧 Weather Impact
- Most common weather conditions
- Weather vs severity analysis

### 🌡 Environmental Factors
- Temperature impact
- Visibility impact
- Wind speed & precipitation effects

### 📍 Geographic Analysis
- State-wise accident distribution
- Accident hotspot heatmap using Folium

---

## 📈 Visualizations Created
- Hourly accident distribution
- Weather condition bar charts
- Severity distribution
- Boxplots (Visibility & Temperature vs Severity)
- Correlation heatmap
- Geographic heatmap

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Folium

---

## 🚀 Key Insights
- Accidents peak during rush hours.
- Poor visibility increases accident severity.
- Weather conditions like rain and fog contribute significantly.
- Certain states show consistently higher accident rates.
- Geographic heatmaps highlight accident-prone regions.
